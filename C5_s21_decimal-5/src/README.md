# s21_decimal

The key concept of the **s21_decimal** project is to create a custom decimal type library for handling high-precision decimal calculations, specifically designed to address limitations and inaccuracies found in standard floating-point representations (e.g., IEEE 754 floats). This new type provides more accurate and reliable handling of financial and mathematical computations where precision is critical.
